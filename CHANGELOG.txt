** Year 2025 ******************************************************************

- 25.1.0 Upgraded to the new version of the Acme framework. The implementation of
the main menu has been reworked to fix many naming inconsistencies.  "Employers" and 
"Workers" are now in a squad called "Customer".  Some listings now use the REST 
controller capabilities in the new version of the framework.

- 25.2.0 Upgraded to the new version of the Acme framework. Added a statement 
with the requirements and a UML domain model.  The data folders were renamed using 
suffix "-01", which enforces the idea that there can be multiple such folders. Heavy
parameter and local-variable renaming in services.  Many trivial asserts have been 
removed from the services since the framework guarantees they are satisfied before 
they get called.  Added good-quality sample data regarding feature employer/job.  
Minor fixes.

model.

doesn't now display the placeholder when used in read-only mode. Minor fixes to custom 
validators. The money-exchange service is now mocked in the development/testing 
platform to help record test cases. Some additional anti-hacking countermeasures were 
implemented. Minor peppered fixes.

- 25.5.0 Upgraded to the new version of the Acme framework. Some additional anti-hacking
countermeasures were implemented.  The project now includes a test suite for features 
"employer/job" and "employer/duty".  Improved hacking counter fight measures regarding 
features: "employer/publish" and "employer/works-for".  Fixed bugs regarding feature 
"administrator/whine".  The "masterId" identifiers have been renamed into more meaningful
identifiers depending on the context. Minor peppered fixes.
